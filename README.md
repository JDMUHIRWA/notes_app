# 📝 Notes App (Flutter + Firebase)

This is a 3-screen note-taking app built with Flutter and Firebase as part of **Individual Assignment 2** for the Mobile Development course.

It allows users to sign up and log in with email/password, then create, read, update, and delete notes in Firestore. State management is handled using the Provider package, and the app follows a clean architecture (presentation, provider, domain, data layers).
